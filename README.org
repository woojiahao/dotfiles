# Linux scripts
* Linux Scripts
  These are a collection of scripts to install various software that I use most frequently.

  These scripts should work with any Arch-based distribution.

  I am currently running them on Manjaro KDE.

** Installation
   1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder
   #+begin_src bash
     git clone https://github.com/woojiahao/linux.git
   #+end_src
   1. Change the permissions of the =setup= script
   #+begin_src bash
     chmod +x setup
   #+end_src
   1. Run the =setup= script as root
   #+begin_src bash
     sudo ./setupp
   #+end_src
