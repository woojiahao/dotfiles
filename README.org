* Dotfiles
  My dotfiles for various application configurations on Linux.

  I am currently running Manjaro Linux with my desktop manager as KDE.

** Installation
   1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder
      #+begin_src bash
        git clone https://github.com/woojiahao/dotfiles.git
      #+end_src
   2. Change the permissions of the =setup= script
      #+begin_src bash
        chmod +x setup
      #+end_src
   3. Run the =setup= script as root
      #+begin_src bash
        sudo ./setup
      #+end_src

** Loading commands
   In order to keep the shell files clean, commands/alias are loaded from the =/scripts= folder. To add these scripts, add the following command to the end of your =.bashrc= or =.zshrc=.

   #+begin_src bash
     for file in ~/linux/scripts/*; do
       source $file
     done
   #+end_src
