# Linux scripts
These are a collection of scripts to install various software that I use most frequently. In theory, these scripts should work on any arch-based distribution. I have tested them on Manjaro GNOME and they are working fine.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
   
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/woojiahao/linux.git
   ```

2. Navigate to this repository
   
   ```bash
   $ cd linux
   ```

3. Change the permission of the script to allow it to be executed
   
   ```bash
   $ sudo chmod -x manjaro-setup.sh
   ```

4. Execute the scripts as root
   
   ```bash
   $ sudo sh manjaro-setup.sh
   ```
